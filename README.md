# Killing Time
Killing Time is a multiplayer mod for Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2.

## Description
In Killing Time, one man has the ability to control Time. Mr Time, in possession of several deadly and realistic firearms, can turn Time to a mere crawl as he flies out from around the corner with guns blazing. Every encounter with Mr Time is guaranteed to be filled with action and style - and of course, death. To counter this man of style and danger, every other player in the game must hunt him down in traditional first-person gameplay. The player who manages to kill Mr Time will take his place.
